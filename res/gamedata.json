It doesn’t seem to be locked.\nAnd finally, luck smiles upon him — inside he finds a sword.\nWith it, he pries open the locked door and enters another room.\n It looks like a sewer or some kind of tomb. It certainly smells like one.\n\nHere begins the player’s adventure, in which he explores dungeons and tries to escape back to the surface.\nAlong the way, traps and enemies await him, making his journey much more difficult.\n He may also encounter a merchant who sells three random items in exchange for gold coins.\nThe player continues moving through rooms until he reaches the exit of the dungeon.\nIf the player dies, the game ends.
